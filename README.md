The model building done in this repository is inspired from https://github.com/ZONG0004/MacroHFT.git

Dataset available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EjlEv57XID0stzUhedlZh-xRQgcdj6Xi?usp=drive_link 
You need access for availing the dataset,
Do take permission from the creator....

file structure-

<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4dcbda7-d3b2-4304-88c9-7e5bc76e3637" />

after setting up the file structure only run the jupyter notebook....
training and testing results are bad as the model was run on cpu...
use gpu 


Some recomended changes in the code-


batch size should be increased to 64 or 128


episodes to 1000


and use the full dataset..                                                                                                                                                                                                    


train_test_split.py is only for dataset splitting in case it is needed

Results and report are for reference delete them before starting the project.
DO provide feedback to make the project even better.

HAPPY CODING!!!!!
